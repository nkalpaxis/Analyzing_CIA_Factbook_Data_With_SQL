# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data With SQL

In this project we'll be working with data from the CIA World Factbook which is a detailed collection of data with statistics about all the countries on Earth. The factbook contains demographic information like population, population growth, and total land and water area. We'll be working with SQL to analyze data from this database. The SQL flavor we'll be using is SQLite, some of the information we'll look to uncover is;

- What is the average population for countries around the world ?
- Which country has the highest population ?
- Which countries have the highest birth rates ?
- What are the average area size of countries ?
